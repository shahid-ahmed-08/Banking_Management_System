# System Design Overview

## Caching Strategy
- **Cache Provider Abstraction:** `banking.cache.CacheProvider` encapsulates cache operations behind a minimal API so the runtime can swap implementations without touching business logic. `CacheProviderFactory` selects between the shipping `InMemoryCacheProvider` and the lightweight `NoOpCacheProvider` using the `CACHE_PROVIDER` environment variable (or `banking.cache.provider` system property).
- **Cache Population:** The `Bank` aggregate owns cache lifecycle. Account mutations (create, deposit, withdraw, transfer, close, and interest accrual) refresh cache entries to keep balances and account snapshots in sync while cache eviction keeps stale entries out of rotation.
- **Read Path:** Lookups (`Bank.getAccount` and `Bank.getAccountBalance`) consult the cache before touching the persistent map. TTLs default to five minutes and can be tuned per cache via `CACHE_ACCOUNT_TTL_SECONDS`, `CACHE_BALANCE_TTL_SECONDS`, or globally with `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`.

## Asynchronous Transaction Processing
- **Message Broker Abstraction:** `MessageBroker` decouples the command queue from execution. The default `InMemoryMessageBroker` runs operations on a worker pool, while the interface enables future adapters for Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- **Transaction Messages:** Each `AccountOperation` is wrapped in a `TransactionMessage` so success/failure callbacks can update caches and observers without blocking the caller.
- **Extensibility:** Replace the in-memory broker with Kafka/RabbitMQ producers and consumers to distribute load across multiple banking service instances.

## Load Balancing & Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Frontends:** Console/UI nodes interact with the shared broker and cache, keeping state in Redis or the persistent store so multiple replicas can serve traffic.
- **Sticky Sessions Not Required:** Because account state lives in the cache/database, requests can be distributed by a Layer-7 load balancer (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB) without session affinity.
- **Idempotent Operations:** Transaction commands should include unique identifiers so downstream consumers can safely retry when scaling message handlers.
- **Observability:** Centralized logging and metrics (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) are recommended to monitor queue depth, cache hit rates, and account throughput as replicas scale.

## Scaling Workflow
1. Deploy Redis (or compatible cache) and point the `CacheProvider` to it.
2. Provision Kafka/RabbitMQ clusters and implement concrete `MessageBroker` adapters.
3. Run multiple BankingApplication instances behind a load balancer; each instance connects to the shared cache, broker, and persistence tier.
4. Use Infrastructure-as-Code manifests in `infra/` to provision and scale infrastructure consistently across environments.
